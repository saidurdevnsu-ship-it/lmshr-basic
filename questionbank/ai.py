single, unambiguous correct answer (for long/creative questions, give a model answer or marking points). \
Avoid near-duplicate questions, and spread questions across the requested topic rather than clustering \
on one paragraph.

For multiple-choice questions give exactly four options, with plausible distractors, and make "answer" \
the exact text of the correct option. For true/false questions, "answer" is "True" or "False". For all \
other types, "options" is an empty list.
